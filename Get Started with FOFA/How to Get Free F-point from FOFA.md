## How to Get Free F-point from FOFA?

### Preface

FOFA has always had a feature, which was previously known as "Asset Update" and is now called "Asset Reward." You may not know what this feature is for.

The precursor of this feature was the "Asset Update" feature. Compared to other features, it may be relatively niche. Users can submit information about assets that have not been found in FOFA through an open data submission interface. 

Once the submission is successful, FOFA will scan and add the asset within 48 hours, and users can then search for all information about the asset on FOFA. The whole process is very simple: Discover assets → Submit it → Successful → Search the asset on FOFA.

However, our boss believes that this relationship is unequal! 

For masters, if FOFA does not have the asset they want, they can choose to use other products directly. So why should users submit asset to FOFA? Apart from love, there is no other reason. Generating electricity for love is not sustainable in the long run.

__"Input and output must be equal."__

Of course, I believe you have noticed that F point is not only used for quota replenishment at present, it has been closely related to the newly launched functions.The application scenarios of F point will continue to expand, and the new functions developed by FOFA in the future will be associated with F point. 

In addition, the main profit point of FOFA comes from enterprises, so we hope that white hats can get F point and play with FOFA in their own way, and jointly maintain the ecology of FOFA. Everyone's love is the biggest driving force for us to move forward.Hence the Asset Reward plan!

### Asset Reward Plan

After officially renaming it as "Asset Reward," this feature has gained two meanings:

Discovering an asset that FOFA has not yet recorded, submitting it for asset reward, and being able to view detailed information about the asset after recorded.


__Uploading asset information from your scan results or asset combing results to FOFA and exchanging them for F-Points.__

__Through this method, users can form a cycle and it is not impossible to completely get F-Points for free from FOFA.__


After a period of manual trial, we have successfully updated the Asset Reward program to an automated F-Points exchange model. For assets that FOFA has not yet recorded, we will provide an exchange standard of __1 data = 1 F-Point__ after recorded.

Of course, please do not intentionally submit assets with wildcard domain names or assets that have 65,535 open ports set up by yourself. Otherwise, we will block the account.

P.S. An ethical hacker has already manually accumulated and exchanged 800,000 F-Points from me. I won't say who it is.

The entire process is very simple: uploaded it → automatically add F-Points. It sounds very joyful~

I will show you the sample steps:

Please note that when a task is generated, the F-Points earned during execution will be credited in real-time, and the maximum number of tasks that can be submitted at a time is 1,000. When the task is completed, you will be able to see how many F-Points were earned for the task.

In the future, we will provide more ways to earn free F points. Wish you Happy hunting in https://en.fofa.info
