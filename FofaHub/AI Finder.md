- By entering the FOFA statement you want to query into the FetchFofa box at the upper right, you can search for corresponding assets in FOFA. Then, automatically filter all the obtained assets, obtain AI model interfaces that can be invoked online, and output the AI interfaces through the FOFA-defined navigation blocks.

## Use Cases

- Individuals with a demand for using AI models.

## How to Use

- Modify the quantity in the "Fetch FOFA" block, currently set to 30, which can be adjusted according to your needs, and then execute.

## Execution Results
- Taking 30 assets as an example, the execution time is between 1 to 2 minutes. The execution effect is shown in the video above, where each clickable block represents an independent AI model.
